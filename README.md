Utilizing Langchain, Generative AI, and Python, I've crafted a project named 'celebrity_info.' The primary file, 'celebrity_info,' orchestrates the seamless integration of these technologies to deliver insightful celebrity information.

Incorporating a streamlined approach, the project's requirements are outlined in the 'requirements.txt' file. A crucial step involves generating a GPT API key, which is then securely placed within the 'constants.py' file for optimal functionality.

The project leverages the GPT API, employing its capabilities to dynamically retrieve detailed information about celebrities, enhancing the depth and accuracy of the output.

To refine user interactions, input prompts are intelligently constrained through a template. The output is tailored to focus on specific details, such as the celebrity's name, date of birth, and five significant global events occurring on that specific date.

Ensuring a seamless user experience, the project incorporates a memory feature. This functionality stores and displays all outputs received through each prompt, providing a comprehensive overview of the information retrieved during the user's interactions.
